Deep Scratch for Android
========================

Deep Scratch was an Android app that allowed simple DJ-like scratching of audio
samples.


History
-------

The main part of Deep Scratch was written in November and December 2010 as
opportunity to learn more about Android development. It was then released in a
free and a pay version that differed in the number of included samples. In
nearly two years the pay version was sold 393 times until it was discontinued.
In December 2012 the code of the two versions was merged, a bit polished and
published under the GPLv3.
